### This program is a wrapper for open source computer vision, which directly enables fast and accurate extensometry analysis of high extension materials. The output of this program is measured video strain with respect to time. In addition, the program enables correlation to load frame stress data to calculate complete uniaxial tension stress-strain curves.
###
## Setup
### Program Requirements
1. Extensometry analysis is only conducted in the horizontal direction
2. Only two points can be tracked
3. Stress correlation assumes load frame end-point at sample failure
